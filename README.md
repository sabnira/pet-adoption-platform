# Pet Adoption Platform

[Live Demo](https://sabnira.github.io/pet-adoption-platform/) 

Peddy Pets is a simple pet adoption web app that allows users to view, filter, and adopt pets fetched from a public API. Users can browse pets by category, sort them by price, view detailed info in a modal, and simulate adoption with interactive buttons. Key features include dynamic filtering, real-time sorting, detailed popups, like/adopt actions, and responsive UI updates. The project uses modern ES6 features such as arrow functions, template literals, the spread operator, `let` and `const`, and promises with `.then()` for handling asynchronous API calls.
